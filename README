Important note

This software initially was not intended for public release, and may contain
a few usability inconveniences. However, known inconveniences are easy to
workaround both during use and by editing the code.
Code contributions (patches) of all types are welcome.


Purpose of the software
For a relatively detailed example, please see <article URL>

Dependencies
antismash2 (run_antismash in the PATH)

Installation


Intended workflow


TODO list
- make the entire workflow contained: only receive GenBank files and options
  as input, then run all the necessary preliminary steps (annotate with
  antismash2, convert to protein multi-fasta, run InParanoid [avoiding
  multiple self-self BLAST searches], Quick- or Multi-Paranoid), and
  produce the final result
- possible optimization: only run InParanoid on the translations of genes
  inside clusters, not the entire genome (i.e. "clustome vs clustome"
  instead of "genome vs genome")
- add mechanisms for discerning highly similar NRPK/PKS clusters,
  e.g. by the domains composition + order inside the cluster
- optimize genbank reading: loop over genbanks instead of reading them
  all into memory (will be important with 20+ genbank files on a
  16GB RAM machine)
- finish the method for identifying "clusters of highly biosynthetic
  clusters"; these can also be weighted, e.g. as the average weight
  of all links
