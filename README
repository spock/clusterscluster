Code contributions (patches) of all types are welcome.

Purpose of the software
=======================
Annotate secondary metabolite biosynthesis clusters in supplied genomes with antismash2,
then compare clusters to find similar and unique ones.
Analyze cluster pairs table, find genomes with the highest absolute unique clusters count.
Examine changes to unique clusters count when changing thresholds.
Plot clusters by type. Plot cumulative unique clusters scatterplot, using genome order resampling.
Perform rarefaction analysis.
For a fairly detailed example, please see <future article URL>
and http://prokars.org/assessment-of-actinobacteria-biosynthetic-potential.html

Dependencies
============
Python 2.7+
antismash2 (possibly but not necessarily patched, see below)
SciPy
Custom-edited Inparanoid 4.1 (included)
Custom-edited quickparanoid (included)
inparanoid:
- perl XML::Parser
R: per-analysis packages (iNEXT, micropan).

Installation
============

Modifying antismash2
--------------------
cluster.py can use a version of antismash which avoids extending clusters using
the rules in cluster_rules.txt. Here's how you can add --no-extensions option to antismash2:
- install antismash2 from git to a location you can write to, add run_antismash
  to PATH;
- apply the supplied 0001-added-support-for-no-extensions-option.patch using
  `git am` to add support for the --no-extensions option (patch was made against
  commit 04532e8aa05ff1039acba5bd11613e929c409eca)
- resolve any possible conflicts while patching.

Dependencies
------------
It should be possible to implement --skip-antismash and feed already-processed genomes into cluster.py.
Otherwise, antismash2 is required.
SciPy.stats dependency is used for gene order correlation calculations.
This dependency can be removed as soon as an alternative (more sensitive) gene synteny method is implemented.
InParanoid and QuickParanoid are only necessary if you intend using genome-wide orthology calculations
to estimate the number of orthologous links between clusters. Use --skip-orthology to skip both.

positional arguments:
  path                  paths to GenBank files with genomes to analyze

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d, --debug           set verbosity level to debug [default: False]

                        alignment (much slower!) [default: False]
  --highmem             assume huge RAM: all GenBanks are loaded early and
                        kept in RAM (faster processing) [default: False]
  --cutoff CUTOFF       protein identity cut-off when aligning with usearch
                        [default: 0.6]
  --skip-putative       exclude putative clusters from the analysis [default:
                        False]
  --skip-orthology      do not run any orthology analysis [default: False]
  --no-name-problems    only use ortho-clusters which do not have diff.names
                        tree_conflict problems [default: False]
  --no-tree-problems    only use ortho-clusters which do not have
                        [diff.names/diff.numbers] tree_conflict problems
                        [default: False]
  --emulate-inparanoid  only print generated inparanoid commands, do not run;

  --project PROJECT     put all the project files into this directory
                        [default: cluster_project]
  --force               insist on re-using existing project directory (this
                        will re-use existing intermediate files) [default:
                        False]
  --no-extensions       pass --no-extensions option to the modified antismash2
                        (see README for details) [default: False]
  --threshold THRESHOLD
                        cluster links with weight below this one will be

                        provided file

TODO list
=========
- check the source code for many more FIXME and TODO tags
- lib/gb2fasta.py is symlinked from another (open) repository; should use git submodules instead
- possible optimization for ortholgoy code: only run InParanoid on the translations of genes
  inside clusters, not entire genomes (i.e. "clustome vs clustome" instead of "genome vs genome")
- add mechanisms for discerning highly similar NRPK/PKS clusters,
  e.g. by the biosynthetic domains composition + domains order
- cleanup (remove or move into external files) obsolete code
