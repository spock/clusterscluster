Important note
==============
This software initially was not intended for public release, and may contain
a few usability inconveniences. However, known inconveniences are easy to
workaround both during use and by editing the code.
Code contributions (patches) of all types are welcome.


Purpose of the software
=======================
For a relatively detailed example, please see <article URL>

Dependencies
============
antismash2 (*modified*, see below)
InParanoid

Installation
============
Modifying antismash2
--------------------
cluster needs a version of antismash which can avoid extending clusters using
the rules in cluster_rules.txt. As of this writing, the --no-extensions was not
yet available in the antismash2 repository. Here's how you can add this option:
- install antismash2 from git to a location you can write to, add run_antismash
  to PATH;
- apply the supplied 0001-added-support-for-no-extensions-option.patch using
  `git am` to add support for the --no-extensions option (patch was made against
  commit 04532e8aa05ff1039acba5bd11613e929c409eca)
- resolve any possible conflicts while patching.

Intended workflow


TODO list
=========
- avoid symlinking to lib/gb2fasta.py; use git submodules instead?
- make the entire workflow contained: only receive GenBank files and options
  as input, then run all the necessary preliminary steps (annotate with
  antismash2, convert to protein multi-fasta, run InParanoid [avoiding
  multiple self-self BLAST searches], Quick- or Multi-Paranoid), and
  produce the final result
- possible optimization: only run InParanoid on the translations of genes
  inside clusters, not the entire genome (i.e. "clustome vs clustome"
  instead of "genome vs genome")
- add mechanisms for discerning highly similar NRPK/PKS clusters,
  e.g. by the domains composition + order inside the cluster
- optimize genbank reading: loop over genbanks instead of reading them
  all into memory (will be important with 20+ genbank files on a
  16GB RAM machine)
- finish the method for identifying "clusters of highly biosynthetic
  clusters"; these can also be weighted, e.g. as the average weight
  of all links
