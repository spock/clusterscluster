Important note

This software initially was not intended for public release, and may contain a few usability inconveniences.
However, known inconveniences are easy to workaround both during use and by editing the code.
Code contributions (patches) of all types are welcome.

Intended workflow


TODO list
- make the entire workflow contained: only receive GenBank files and options as input,
  then run all the necessary preliminary steps (annotate with antismash2, convert to
  protein multi-fasta, run InParanoid [avoiding multiple self-self BLAST searches],
  Quick- or Multi-Paranoid), and produce the final result
- possible optimization: only run InParanoid on the translations of genes inside clusters,
  not the entire genome (i.e. "clustome vs clustome" instead of "genome vs genome")
- add mechanisms for discerning highly similar NRPK/PKS clusters, e.g. by the domains
  composition+order inside the cluster
- optimize genbank reading: loop over genbanks instead of reading them all into memory
  (will be important with 20+ genbank files on a 16GB RAM machine)
- finish the method for identifying "clusters of highly biosynthetic clusters"; these
  can also be weighted, e.g. as the average weight of all links
